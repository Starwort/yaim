[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

An additional open-source i18n manager (as the open-source ones all seem to be bad, and the good ones all seem to be paid-plan)

## Usage

Install all dependencies: `npm i`

To run the app: `npm run electron`

To develop the app: `npm start` in one console, and `npm run electron-dev` in another.

In addition to the Electron app, [a web version](https://starbright.dyndns.org/yaim) is available.
