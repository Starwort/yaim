# Yet Another I18n Manager

No content yet: Planned to be an additional open-source i18n manager (as the open-source ones all seem to be bad, and the good ones all seem to be paid-plan)

To run the app's shell: `npm run electron`

To develop the app: `npm start` in one console, and `npm run electron-dev` in another.
