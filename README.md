# Yet Another I18n Manager

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

An additional open-source i18n manager (as the open-source ones all seem to be bad, and the good ones all seem to be paid-plan)

## Usage

<!--
To run the app's shell: `npm run electron`

To develop the app: `npm start` in one console, and `npm run electron-dev` in another.
-->
Due to an issue with Electron and the File System Access API, the Electron version of this app does not work properly. However, [the web version](https://starbright.dyndns.org/yaim) can be used instead, and will remain live until Electron can be used.

If you wish to help develop the app, you can run `npm start` to start the debug server, and either open the app in a browser or run `npm run electron-dev` to launch Electron.
